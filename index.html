        <header><h2>Using Washer</h2></header>
        <h3>1. Sort and prepare your laundry</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Empty pockets. Loose change, buttons, or any small 
object can pass under the agitator and become trapped, 
causing unexpected sounds.</li>
          <li>Sort items by recommended cycle, water temperature, 
and colorfastness.</li> 
          <li>Separate heavily soiled items from lightly soiled.</li>
          <li>Separate delicate items from sturdy fabrics.</li> 
          <li>Do not dry garments if stains remain after washing 
because heat can set stains into fabric.</li>
          <li>Treat stains promptly.</li>
          <li>Close zippers, fasten hooks, tie strings and sashes, 
and remove non-washable trim and ornaments.</li>
          <li>Mend rips and tears to avoid further damage to items 
during washing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Helpful Tips:</h4> 
        <ul>
          <li>When washing water-proof or water-resistant items, 
load evenly.</li>
          <li>Use mesh garment bags to help avoid tangling when 
washing delicate or small items.</li>
          <li>Turn knits inside out to avoid pilling. Separate lint-takers 
from lint-givers. Synthetics, knits, and corduroy fabrics 
will pick up lint from towels, rugs, and chenille fabrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOTE: Always read and follow fabric care label instructions 
to avoid damage to your garments.</p>
        <h3>2. Add laudry products</h3>
        <p>Add a measured amount of detergent or single-dose 
laundry packet into the basket.
If using Oxi-type boosters, color-safe bleach, or 
fabric-softener crystals, add to the bottom of the washer 
basket before adding clothes.</p>
<p>NOTE: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to determine 
the amount of laundry products to use.</p>
        <h3>3. Load laundry into washer</h3>
        <p>Load garments in loose heaps evenly 
around basket wall. For best results, do 
not pack the load tightly. Do not wrap 
large items such as sheets around the 
agitator; load them in loose piles around 
the sides of the basket. Try mixing 
different-sized items to reduce tangling.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Do not tightly pack or 
force items into washer. Items need to move freely 
for best cleaning and to reduce wrinkling and tangling.</p>
        <h3>4. Add liquid chlorine bleach to dispenser</h3>
        <p>Do not overfill, dilute, or use more than 1 cup (236 mL). 
Do not use color-safe bleach or Oxi products in the same 
cycle with liquid chlorine bleach.</p>
        <h3>5. Add fabric softener to dispenser</h3>
        <p>Pour a measured amount of liquid fabric 
softener into dispenser. Always follow 
manufacturer’s directions for correct amount 
of fabric softener based on your load size. 
Dilute liquid fabric softener by filling the dispenser with warm 
water until liquid reaches the underside of the rim. See Max Fill 
line arrows.</p> 
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Fabric Softener knob must be set to “Yes” 
when using the fabric softener dispenser. This ensures that 
fabric softener is added at the correct time in the rinse for 
even distribution.
          <h3>6. Select cycle</h3>
          <p>Turn cycle knob to choose your wash cycle. For more 
information, see the “Cycle Guide” chart.</p>
          <h3>7. Select WASH TEMPERATURE</h3>
          <p>Once you select a cycle, select the wash temperature by 
turning the Wash Temperature knob to the desired setting. 
Always read and follow fabric care label instructions to 
avoid damage to your items.</p>
          <h3>8. Press START/STOP
to begin wash cycle</h3>
          <p>Press START/STOP to start the wash cycle. When the cycle 
has finished, the Cycle Complete indicator will light. Promptly 
remove garments after cycle has completed to avoid odor, 
reduce wrinkling, and prevent rusting of metal hooks, zippers, 
and snaps.</p>

        <header><h2>Safety Instructions</h2></header>
        <h3>IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p><b>WARNING</b> To reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury to persons when using the washer, follow basic precautions, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read all instructions before using the washer.</li>
          <li>Do not wash articles that have been previously cleaned in, washed in, soaked in, or spotted with gasoline, dry-cleaning solvents, other flammable, or explosive substances as they give off vapors that could ignite or explode.</li>
          <li>Do not add gasoline, dry-cleaning solvents, or other flammable, or explosive substances to the wash water. These substances give off vapors that could ignite or explode. Under certain conditions, hydrogen gas may be produced in a hot water system that has not been used for 2 weeks or more. HYDROGEN GAS IS
          EXPLOSIVE. If the hot water system has not been used for such a period, before using the washing machine, turn on all hot water faucets and let the water flow from each for several minutes. This will release any accumulated hydrogen gas. As the gas is flammable, do not smoke or use an open flame during this time.</li>
          <li>Do not allow children to play on or in the washer. Close supervision of children is necessary when the washer is used near children.</li>
          <li>Before the washer is removed from service or discarded, remove the door or lid.</li>
          <li>Do not reach into the washer if the drum, tub or agitator is moving.</li>
          <li>Do not install or store the washer where it will be exposed to the weather.</li>
          <li>Do not tamper with controls.</li>
          <li>Do not repair or replace any part of the washer or attempt any servicing unless specifically recommended in this manual or in published user-repair instructions that you understand and have the skills to carry out.</li>
          </li>See Installation Instructions for grounding instructions.</li>
        </ul>
